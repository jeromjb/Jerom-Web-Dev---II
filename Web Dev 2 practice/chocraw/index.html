His commitment to creating fine, artisan chocolates won him a devoted audience right away. John transformed chocolate-making into an art form by experimenting with distinctive flavors and cutting-edge methods while using only the best ingredients. As word got out, Westons—famous for its trademark truffles and thick, velvety bars—went from being a local favorite to a well-loved brand.
